* Dotfiles
  I sneaked the install script which takes care of stow [[https://github.com/kkhan01/dotfiles][here]] .
  These are all config files that I have dabbled with in the past, or
  something I use today, some things more frequently than others... like
  the .emacs.d config so that will obviously be updated more frequently.

* Install instructions
  Whatever you do, do not do this:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone https://github.com/Dreameh/dotfiles.git
  cd dotfiles; ./install
  #+END_SRC

  That's not how you should do it, you should do this:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone https://github.com/Dreameh/dotfiles.git
  cd dotfiles
  ./install PROGRAM
  #+END_SRC
  the parameter =PROGRAM= is a placeholder for you to replace with
  whatever exists in the dotfiles repository and it will then get
  symlinked and then you can start use it.
